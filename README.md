# Overview
Our data is a census tracts in New York City. It shows the income level, total population, race, poverty level and different types of jobs in New York City and surrounding area. We are trying to figure out which of these features affect the median household income and income per capita. We sought to predict the income level based on useful information like population, job positions and other useful features. In addition, we are trying to investigate these questions:
- Which area has higher income per capita?
- Which area has higher unemployment rate?
- Can we integrate these useful features into some predictive models that would predict income level and income per capita in the future?
- What is the relationship between race and median household income?

We wanted to answer these questions after studying and visualizing this data.
